# Scheirer-Ray-Hare-Test

Python script to perform the Scheirer-Ray-Hare Test

This script performs the Scheirer-Ray-Hare Test on the exercise from 'Real Statistics Using Excel'. See the below website for information on the test and the exercise

http://www.real-statistics.com/two-way-anova/scheirer-ray-hare-test/

The data should be in a dataframe with three columns:

Factor 1 (Fertilizer)
Factor 2 (Crop)
Measurement

For this repository, I created a file with the data from the original exercise. 

However, the code should be adaptable to any dataset provided the assumptions for the test, and the formats are the same.

The code is on a Jupyter Lab Notebook.
